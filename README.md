# An introduction to ML for Hacklab at the Harvard Innovation Lab

## Installation
If you don't have everything working yet (or maybe even if you do, go to http://continuum.io/downloads to get
the Anaconda Python distribution. It will make installation a lot easier and you'll be able to edit your code
inside the browser!

Install the Natural Language Toolkit:

> conda install nltk

Download the base corpus:

> import nltk; nltk.download()

Start the IPython notebook:

> ipython notebook --matplotlib=inline

## Teacher Intro
My name is Brendan Kohler. I'm a VC and co-founder of **Hyperplane Venture Capital**, a VC firm focused exclusively
on companies bringing ML related technologies to market. I'm also co-founder of a new cloud infrastructure company
called Sentenai.

## TA Intro
With me today is Stephen Diehl, chief architect at Elsen and a well known face in the Python numerical computing community.
If you're as fascinated with CS as I am, you'll find his website a treasure trove of cool Python and Haskell lessons.

## Hacklab intro

We'll be doing two introductory sets to start with, before everyone can break out into groups to work on their own projects.

### Generating random text with Markov Chains

### Supervised and Unsupervised learning with sklearn
